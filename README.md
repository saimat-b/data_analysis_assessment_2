# Data Analysis Assessment 2
*Saimat Balabekova*

This was the second assessment for my Quantitative Data Analysis Module. The aim of this assessment was to provide structure for the initial stages of research for the MA Dissertation. At that stage I wanted to look at Covid Data because I wanted to write a Dissertation on the relationship between political populism,economic stability of a nation and AntiVax movement. I ended up writing a Dissertation on Cyber Warfare between nation states instead because at that point in time I did not have access to up to date data.
